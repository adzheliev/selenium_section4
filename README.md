### :man_technologist: About Me:

```python
class PythonDeveloper:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Alan Dzheliev"
        self.role = "PythonDeveloper"
        self.language_spoken = ["ru_RU", "en_US", "it_IT"]

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Hello there!")


me = PythonDeveloper()
me.say_hi()
```

Diligent, cooperative, and results-driven, I am passionate about coding and constantly strive to learn new methods and approaches that accelerate and simplify the development process while bringing beauty to the code. As a self-professed perfectionist, I take pride in writing clean and concise code. Additionally, I have experience as a mentor, assisting newcomers in solving problems during our course. <br/>

Prior to my transition into software development, I worked as a professional translator and localization engineer for over 15 years. This extensive linguistic background, coupled with more than 23 years of language practice, gives me a unique perspective in the field. Seeking interesting projects and complex tasks, I decided to pursue a career in software development. <br/>

At the moment, I am actively seeking to join a strong software development team that aligns with my goals and aspirations. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals to create impactful solutions. <br/>
